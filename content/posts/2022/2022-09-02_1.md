Four tips before starting:

1) Understand that we are attempting to solve a problem by doing something different.
2) Make sure the numbers are correct, especially when it comes to taxes and how they will effect the treasury.
3) Establish the right team and motivate them every day.
4) Personal and professional purpose.

Without proper attention, each of them can lead to failure.
