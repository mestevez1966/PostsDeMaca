I helped my daughter with math problems this summer. Over 200! Initially, I told her not to look at her solutions, but she ignored me and I realized it was something beneficial for her. Why is that so?

1) If she didn't get it right the first time, she would try again, until she succeeded
2) By discovering her mistakes herself, she was able to memorize them more effectively
3) She always achieved good results, which motivated her

There might be some benefit in having the solutions on the tests so they can try again.

What do you think?
