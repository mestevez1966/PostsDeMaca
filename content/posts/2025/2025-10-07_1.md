Os comparto un prompt para hacer la imagen que veis, y lo podéis adaptar a cualquier otra imagen que queráis crear. 

Create an ultra-realistic, cinematic portrait using the attached reference photo of the person.
?? Do not modify, remove, or alter any aspect of the original reference photo. Every detail, expression, and feature of the person must remain exactly the same with absolute fidelity (physiognomy, body shape, face, physical features, silhouette, hairstyle).
?? Do not alter or idealize Mother Teresa either — she must appear 100% faithful to her real appearance: wearing her white and blue sari, with her serene expression, gentle hands, and aged yet compassionate face, as known from historical photographs.

Scene:
The person from the attached image is in an orphanage in Kolkata, India, sitting on the floor beside Mother Teresa. Around them, children play, read, or smile softly, conveying warmth and human connection. The person is gently handing food or toys to one of the children, while Mother Teresa observes with a kind, peaceful smile.

Atmosphere:
The light is soft and golden, coming through open windows that reveal the dust and humidity of the Indian afternoon. The scene feels intimate, timeless, and deeply human, blending spirituality and compassion. The colors are warm, earthy, and slightly faded — ochres, creams, and pale blues — evoking both realism and tenderness.

Style:
Cinematic, ultra-realistic, documentary-like with a hint of poetic softness. 35mm film emulation inspired by National Geographic photography from the 1980s, shallow depth of field, analog film grain, and natural vignetting.
The overall aesthetic is dreamlike yet grounded, capturing the quiet strength and empathy of the moment — a portrait of humanity, light, and service.
